    "## Geographic Data Science with Python\n",
    "- Geographic Data Science: The study of geographic problems using data and computational methods.\n",
    "- Intersection of GIS, spatial statistics, and data science\n",
    "- Aside from the usual cross-sectional data that we have been working with, we will also be working with spatial data.\n",
    "- This could be data that is explicitly geographic, such as GPS coordinates, or data that has a geographic component, such as addresses or zip codes.\n",
    "- Application to Economics:\n",
    "    - Geographic market definition in antitrust proceedings\n",
    "    - Spatial econometrics - study of spatial relationships in economic data such as spatial autocorrelation in house prices\n",
    "    - Urban economics - study of cities and their spatial organization\n",
    "    - Environmental economics - study of the spatial distribution of pollution and its effects\n",
    "    - Regional economics - study of the spatial distribution of economic activity\n",
    "    - Transportation economics - study of the spatial distribution of transportation networks\n",
    "    - Economic geography - study of the spatial distribution of economic activity\n",

    "## Spatial Data\n",
    "- Spatial data is data that has a geographic component to it.\n",
    "- Importance: \n",
    "    - Many datasets have a geographic component to them.\n",
    "    - Geographic data can be used to answer questions that are not possible with non-geographic data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Spatial Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Vector Data**: \n",
    "- Vector data represents geographic features as points, lines, and polygons.\n",
    "- Points: Represent a single location in space.\n",
    "- Lines: Represent a series of connected points.\n",
    "- Polygons: Represent a closed shape made up of a series of connected points.\n",
    "- usual file formats:\n",
    "    - Shapefiles (.shp): widely used but also requires multiple files (.shp, .shx, .dbf, etc.)\n",
    "    - GeoJSON (.geojson): JSON-based format that is easy to read and write, used in web applications\n",
    "    - GeoPackage (.gpkg): SQLite-based format that can store multiple layers in a single file\n",
    "    - KML (.kml): XML-based format used in Google Earth\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Raster Data**:\n",
    "- Raster data represents geographic features as a grid of cells.\n",
    "- *gridded spatial data* such as satellite imagery, digital elevation models, and climate data.\n",
    "- examples:\n",
    "    - Land cover data: classifies each cell as forest, water, urban, etc.\n",
    "    - Elevation data: gives the elevation of each cell above sea level.\n",
    "    - Climate data: gives temperature, precipitation, etc. for each cell.\n",
    "- usual file formats:\n",
    "    - GeoTIFF (.tif): widely used format for raster data\n",
    "    - NetCDF (.nc): format for storing gridded data in climate science\n",
    "    - HDF5 (.h5): format for storing large datasets in scientific computing\n",
    "- Source of raster data:\n",
    "    - NASA Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS)\n",
    "    - US Geological Survey (USGS)\n",
    "    - National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)\n",
    "    - European Space Agency (ESA)\n",
    "    - Google Earth Engine\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS)**:\n",
    "- Coordinate reference systems (CRS) are used to define the location of geographic data.\n",
    "- Geographic data is usually stored in a two-dimensional space, with the x-axis representing longitude and the y-axis representing latitude.\n",
    "- WHY IMPORTANT: Different CRSs can represent the same location in different ways, so it is important to know the CRS of your data.\n",
    "- Common CRSs:\n",
    "    - WGS 84 (EPSG:4326): standard CRS for GPS data\n",
    "    - Web Mercator (EPSG:3857): standard CRS for web maps\n",
    "    - Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM): standard CRS for large-scale mapping\n",
    "    - State Plane Coordinate System (SPCS): standard CRS for US states\n",
    "    - Ordnance Survey National Grid (OSGB): standard CRS for UK\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Basic Spatial Operations**:\n",
    "- Spatial operations are used to analyze and wrangle spatial data.\n",
    "- Examples:\n",
    "    - Buffering: creating a buffer around a point, line, or polygon\n",
    "    - Clipping: extracting a subset of a dataset based on a spatial boundary\n",
    "    - Overlay: combining two datasets based on their spatial relationship\n",
    "    - Interpolation: estimating values at unsampled locations based on nearby samples\n",
    "    - Proximity: finding the nearest point, line, or polygon to a given location\n"
